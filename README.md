# PictoPass
This is an image to password convertor which calculates the SHA-256 hash value of a file.

 # How this works
 PictoPass calculates the SHA-256 hash value of a file, given the file's location specified by the user.
 
 # Input
 The input for this code is the location (i.e., file path) of an image file that you want to calculate the SHA-256 hash value for.

When you run the code, you will be prompted to enter the file location in the console by the input function with the message "Enter file location: ".

For example, if you have an image file named "myimage.jpg" located in the "C:\Images" folder on your computer, you should enter the file location as:

```
C:\Images\myimage.jpg



```

Uploading an image and choosing the hash algorithm to convert it into.


Please note that you should enter the file location with the correct file path syntax for your operating system. For example, on Linux or macOS, the file path separator is "/", not "" like on Windows.
